# Auto-encoders
ðŸ“¸ Autoencoders for MNIST / CIFAR Prediction

The goal of this repo is to create very basic versions of the foundational models through which today's large models create image predictions. We start from auto-encoders, then make variational auto-encoders, and finally use VQVAEs, which is what is often known to be used in large language models.
